# T3Code host adapter

Status: native adapter, CLI-helper reporting, board questions and per-project host opt-in are implemented.
Owner: Nucleus runtime maintainers

## Boundary

T3Code supplies native thread operations. Nucleus continues to own task and run
identity, worktrees, durable effect intent, callback authentication, review and
merge policy. Service composition injects those policies through `core/host`;
the adapter never imports their implementation or another host. Paseo remains
the primary host (Tom, 2026-11-11).

Worker, reviewer and recovery identities are separate top-level T3 threads.
No role uses T3's delegated-task relationship. The adapter does not patch T3,
attach Nucleus MCP servers, raise Nucleus questions inside threads or contribute
T3 UI. A T3 thread reports through the packaged nucleus helper with the run
ticket named in its prompt. Nucleus-raised questions go to the web board and
the project planner's agent channel. A repository setting selects `paseo`
(default) or `t3code` (opt-in) for new tasks; a live task never changes host.
Registering a transport must not make an unsupported task workflow executable.

## Protocol and connection

The implementation lives behind `hosts/t3code/index.ts`. Its small RPC client
owns wire encoding, bounded responses, cancellation, deadlines and subscription
cleanup; adapter modules translate those responses into Nucleus host contracts.
No unpublished T3 package becomes a dependency.

The proof target is nightly `0.1.6-nightly.20261030.3917`, source
[`97e35bcf23e4dcf34c2dcffadd37c08db0e01e52`](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/tree/97e35bcf23e4dcf34c2dcffadd37c08db0e01e52),
identified by the installed app's build metadata and matching release. The newer
planner research checkout is navigation evidence, not the proof target. Version
strings are diagnostic facts, never an allowlist. A newer nightly may connect
when the required protocol and decoded structures match. The owner-only state
file records the last nightly version that passed the read-only connect probe.
The target nightly uses orchestration protocol `2`.

Connection order:

1. Read an optional local T3 connection configuration with endpoint and session
   bearer issued through `t3 auth session issue`. Keep it owner-only and outside
   the repository; expose no bearer in settings responses, diagnostics or logs.
2. Exchange the bearer at `/api/auth/websocket-ticket/rpc`, then open `/ws` with
   the short-lived ticket and the supported orchestration protocol. The client needs
   `orchestration:read` and `orchestration:operate`; missing scopes fail closed.
3. Read `server.getConfig` through the authenticated socket. Validate
   `environment.environmentId`, `serverVersion` and
   `orchestrationProtocolVersion`. Then strictly decode a full shell snapshot
   and one thread subscription, including every field Nucleus consumes.
   A missing method, missing field or changed field type refuses connection
   with its exact name. A missing protocol version is also a refusal.
   The public environment descriptor is only a preflight hint.
4. Only after those probes, claim `t3code:<environmentId>` in the existing host
   registry. Reconnecting must prove the same environment at the same endpoint. Give this host its own
   admission and breaker state; disconnect only its session token.

The wire is Effect RPC JSON: `Request` frames carry an ID, method tag, payload
and headers; `Exit` settles unary calls; `Chunk` carries subscription values and
requires `Ack`; `Interrupt` releases a subscription. The client validates the
subset it consumes. Malformed frames, error exits, premature stream completion,
timeouts and disconnects invalidate affected reads. Ticket URLs, headers and
raw remote error bodies are never logged.
Strict decoding validates consumed fields and their types while tolerating
unrelated extra fields, so additive nightly changes do not become version pins.

T3 provides no RPC schema discovery or dry run. Never send a canary mutation to
establish compatibility. Pin the target nightly's command shapes as synthetic
contract fixtures and compare them with newer nightly source during the drift
check; the version itself does not decide compatibility.
If no readable thread exists for the subscription probe, compatibility remains
unestablished with a clear diagnostic; do not create a probe thread on a live host.

Mutation shapes are checked on first use. The target nightly decodes request
schemas before invoking handlers, but serializes decoder errors and handler
defects without a decode-phase tag. Identical schema-formatted text can come
from a handler after an effect, so every remote failure remains unknown delivery
and is never resent. Only a local refusal before the socket write proves
non-delivery (planner ruling, 2026-11-11). Sanitized reported command and field
names remain diagnostic text, never proof of a decoder phase; raw error bodies,
actual values and credentials are omitted.
Those names are stored on the durable unknown intent and returned on blocked
repeats, including after reload. A registered permission failure also records
them through the owning task's existing attention policy, selected by its exact
host, agent and workspace identity; standalone native operations retain them in
the intent ledger without inventing a task owner.

## Identity and workspaces

Native T3 thread IDs stay opaque. Existing task, run, message and question host
fields qualify them; a legacy string prefix grants no host attribution. Equal
native IDs on Paseo and T3 must resolve to different participants. A missing host
or ambiguous inventory cannot authorize a callback or answer.

T3's project and existing Git worktree form its workspace handle. Persist their
mapping through the service's durable intent boundary, including the canonical
directory, project ID, task/run ownership and native thread ID. Do not recover
ownership from titles or tags. Discovery uses complete host inventory plus this
map. An unreadable map or partial inventory is unknown, never an empty result.

Nucleus prepares and verifies the Git worktree before handing it to T3. Creation
uses only `existing_worktree`; T3 must confirm it belongs to the selected project.
The adapter never asks T3 to create, rename, remove or clean a worktree. Thread
archive is a catalog operation, not evidence that a folder was removed. Native
workspace operations without an equivalent must explicitly refuse rather than
pretend to be a Paseo workspace.

## Operations and delivery

| Host operation | T3 RPC or command | Required result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create | `orchestration.launchThread` with explicit thread/message IDs, provider instance/model, prompt and `existing_worktree` | Top-level thread with the exact project and directory |
| Follow-up | `orchestration.dispatchCommand` / `message.dispatch` | Stable command and message IDs; receipt records acceptance |
| Observe | `orchestration.subscribeShell` and `orchestration.subscribeThread` | Fresh complete state, including active run and pending request |
| Answer question or permission | `runtime-request.respond` through dispatch | Exact request, thread and workspace; typed answers or approval decision |
| Stop | `thread.stop` through dispatch | Receipt followed by observation; never a replacement thread |
| Archive | `thread.archive` through dispatch | Receipt followed by archived-state observation |

Use `launchThread` for creation because it supplies the native workspace strategy
and initial-message preparation. Other mutations use `dispatchCommand`. Each
operation binds a stable command ID, native target and canonical payload to the
existing durable intent before send. Launch also binds its explicit thread and
initial-message IDs. Persist the mapping before remote creation so a lost reply
cannot produce an unowned thread.

The adapter's owner-only state file binds those records to the authenticated
environment. Synchronous exclusive locking and atomic, synced replacement keep
intent durable across a crash. A held or abandoned lock refuses writes; the
adapter never guesses that a prior process finished. Settled commands return
their recorded outcome; unresolved commands are never resent.

Runtime responses also bind the native thread/request pair to their original
intent and caller input before reading the request's current status. The binding
is reserved atomically with the intent, so concurrent callers and new intent IDs
cannot send another answer while delivery is unknown. A settled identical answer
replays locally, even after the request resolves, expires or disappears; changed
answers do not rewrite that outcome. Question answers and dismissals share this
request scope. Earlier unbound intents are inspected rather than ignored.

T3 receipts reject a command ID belonging to another thread, but do not compare
payloads on the same thread. Nucleus must reject a changed payload under an
existing intent ID locally. A transport reconnect does not resend a mutation.
An uncertain result stays uncertain until native receipt/projection evidence
settles that exact intent. Never resend an uncertain mutation to obtain its
receipt, or replace the command or thread ID to escape doubt.

Guarded sends retain core's `allowed`, `stillAllowed` and `beforeSend` ordering.
The last synchronous fence precedes the socket write. A proven local refusal
uses the existing pre-send error/result. After a possible write, remote errors
cannot establish non-delivery. A command receipt proves acceptance, not provider
completion or a Nucleus report.

## Observation and restart

Start with an unfiltered shell subscription and explicitly read
`orchestration.getArchivedShellSnapshot`; the target nightly's live shell loader
does not include archived records even though its schema has an archive array.
Do not enable omission of older settled threads or idle children. Require the
initial snapshot and synchronization/completion evidence before answering an inventory
read. Each read takes a fresh synchronized snapshot; an intervening event,
reconnect, invalid update or unfinished snapshot refuses that read. There is no
cached inactivity to carry across connections. Read the thread
projection when shell summaries lack request details or timeline coverage.
Project-enrichment snapshots marked with `resolvedRepositoryIdentityRoots` can
carry empty thread arrays; they never replace the authoritative inventory.

Report active run, idle, pending question/permission and archived state from
positive native facts. A thread is gone only after a complete authoritative read
proves absence/deletion. Partial reads reject or return the contract's unknown
result. A disconnected thread never becomes idle or gone by timeout. Timeline
pages retain gap and coverage facts; a bounded tail is not full history.
Active and archive snapshots must report the same application-event sequence;
otherwise their union is refused as incomplete. This includes an unarchive
between the two reads, which could otherwise hide a live thread. A direct
retained-thread read must settle an identity before reporting it gone. Coverage
flags and cursors are strictly typed; retyped fields or a remaining history
cursor cannot establish complete observation or timeline coverage.

On T3 startup, active runs are cancelled and live approvals expire. Pending
questions may remain pending with `responseCapability: {type: "message"}`.
Read this capability from the fresh thread projection and answer through
`runtime-request.respond`, which owns the message-based continuation. Do not
invent a second follow-up. Expired or nonresumable approvals cannot be answered
again. An interrupted answer remains uncertain even if the request later expires;
expiry is not evidence that the original answer was never delivered.

## Composition and unsupported capabilities

Service composition reads optional T3 configuration and imports only its public
host index. It registers the second connection independently of Paseo. Replace
single-connection assumptions only where needed to select the recorded host,
enumerate sessions and account for shutdown. Preserve the existing Paseo identity,
configuration, SDK behavior, callbacks and migration history.

The authenticated `host.permission-answer` service method requires the exact
host, native agent, workspace, runtime request, decision and stable intent.
It selects only that registered host, with no fallback, and uses its permission
response through the host facade. The native adapter rechecks the pending
request's kind and workspace before delivery.

Expose explicit unsupported capabilities for per-thread MCP reporting,
Nucleus-raised native decisions and UI contributions. Do not substitute empty
success results. The Host keeps `lifecycleDispatch` false; the Adapter turns it
on once the Nucleus helper path is wired, so T3 threads report through the
helper and ticket named in the prompt. Service composition injects
`HostPolicies` through the public `core/host` constructor, so review
verification (live author/reviewer independence and exact-head checks) and
retained-thread continuation, recovery and checkpoint delivery use the same
core policy as Paseo. The Adapter also supplies `askReviewer` and `askPlanner`
(a `queue_after_active` send; the consultation prompt binds `PASEO_AGENT_ID` to
the recipient so `question.answer` authenticates on T3's empty per-thread
environment) and `findRunAgents` (exact `nucleus.run` plus `nucleus.task` label
lookup), so a helper ask reaches a retained T3 reviewer or a T3 project planner
and uncertain reviewer or coordinator creation can bind. `host.permission-answer` still grants no
task lifecycle dispatch. An unconfigured T3 adapter changes no default route. A
configured second host never causes implicit rerouting of a live task, origin
notice or pending question.

## Trial

Paseo stays the primary host. Opt a repository into T3Code for new tasks:

1. Start T3Code.
2. Issue a session bearer with `t3 auth session issue`.
3. Write owner-only local settings (outside the repository, never logged): `t3code: { endpoint, bearer, probeThreadId? }`.
4. In Settings, set the repository Host to T3Code, or `repository.set` with `hostKind: "t3code"`.
5. Switch back to Paseo the same way. Live tasks keep the host they started on.

## Verification

Fake-server tests cover each operation, the exact wire envelopes and scopes,
authorization refusal, missing/incompatible protocol, a previously untested
nightly passing structural probes, identity conflicts, malformed
and incomplete snapshots, lost replies, immutable intent replay, subscription
cleanup and restart during both kinds of request. Identical decoder-formatted
and post-effect handler defects must both retain unknown delivery. Contract
fixtures pin the nightly command shapes rather than a server-version allowlist.
Cross-host cases deliberately reuse native IDs and keep task, run, message and
question ownership separate.

The private proof starts an unmodified checkout of the target nightly revision,
or its bundled server copied into fresh run scratch, with separate home, data,
configuration and synthetic Git project/worktree. A local scripted provider drives questions, approvals and a
stoppable run without operator provider credentials. It must exercise the real
T3 server and RPC, not replace the orchestration service. Configure networking
on loopback; issue the bearer only from that private instance. Never discover
or reuse a live T3 home, session or desktop data directory.
Seed a synthetic thread during private fixture setup for the read-only connect
probe; that setup is confined to the private server.

Retain redacted observations for create, follow-up, observe, answer, stop and
archive, plus compatibility refusal and restart behavior, with source revision,
nightly version and protocol. Re-check the newest nightly at the end and report
command/schema drift separately from runtime proof on the target nightly.
Store proof artifacts only in scratch; public PR text includes
no local paths, credentials or private project names. Execute the proof through
an Effigy selector, and keep every process and temporary root owned by the run.

Implementation acceptance requires `effigy check`, each new adapter test file
alone, `test/host-composition.test.ts`, `test/host-identity-boundary.test.ts` and
`test/folder-imports.test.ts` alone, `effigy qa:docs`, and the private proof.
The private proof selector is `effigy proof:t3code -- --asar <nightly archive>`.
It copies the target app's bundled server into fresh scratch and uses a scripted
local provider. Its evidence distinguishes source drift, injected incompatible
read responses and actual lifecycle operations on the private nightly.
